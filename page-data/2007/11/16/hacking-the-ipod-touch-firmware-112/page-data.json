I bought one last week, and I didn’t regret it for a second. The navigation and animations are so intuitive, Apple is really pushing the boundaries a little further again :-)</p>\n<p>However, running 3rd pary apps on the touch isn’t that simple. I tried hacking it yesterday, but ran a hack for the earliers 1.1.1 firmware, which didn’t succeed and included copying DMG files and doing SSH and SFTP. Today, I resetted the firmware and tried another hack, WITH succes. I won’t repeat the proces over here, but <a href=\"http://kaspers.freeflux.net/blog/archive/2007/11/12/ipod-touch-1-1-1-to-1-1-2-upgrade-guide.html\">check it out at Koos Kaspers</a>. I’m already running the iPhone apps, and some 3rd party ones like Apollo (IM client), NES emulator and iSplit. Any other good apps you know of?</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/11/16/hacking-the-ipod-touch-firmware-112/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"hacking the ipod Touch firmware 1.1.2","date":"16 Nov, 2007","description":false,"tags":["apple","ipod","ipod touch"],"hasCover":false,"cover":{"publicURL":"/static/38bf334212404fb8f25838f80898b83a/preview.png","childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"tracedSVG":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='62'%20height='62'%20viewBox='0%200%2062%2062'%20preserveAspectRatio='none'/%3e","aspectRatio":0.7493606138107417,"src":"/static/38bf334212404fb8f25838f80898b83a/21b0e/preview.png","srcSet":"/static/38bf334212404fb8f25838f80898b83a/12aff/preview.png 293w,\n/static/38bf334212404fb8f25838f80898b83a/8dd70/preview.png 585w,\n/static/38bf334212404fb8f25838f80898b83a/21b0e/preview.png 690w","srcWebp":"/static/38bf334212404fb8f25838f80898b83a/f3dc3/preview.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/38bf334212404fb8f25838f80898b83a/05ceb/preview.webp 293w,\n/static/38bf334212404fb8f25838f80898b83a/5c538/preview.webp 585w,\n/static/38bf334212404fb8f25838f80898b83a/f3dc3/preview.webp 690w","sizes":"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px"}}}}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/11/16/hacking-the-ipod-touch-firmware-112/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2007/11/08/fotb07-rocked/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"FOTB07 rocked","tags":["Conferences"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2007/12/18/cakeswxphp-simpler-and-on-cake-12/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"cakeswxphp: simpler and on cake 1.2","tags":["amfphp","cakephp","cakeswxphp","swx"]}},"tag":["apple","ipod","ipod touch"]}}}
