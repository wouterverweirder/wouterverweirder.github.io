I bought one last week, and I didn’t regret it for a second. The navigation and animations are so intuitive, Apple is really pushing the boundaries a little further again :-)</p>\n<p>However, running 3rd pary apps on the touch isn’t that simple. I tried hacking it yesterday, but ran a hack for the earliers 1.1.1 firmware, which didn’t succeed and included copying DMG files and doing SSH and SFTP. Today, I resetted the firmware and tried another hack, WITH succes. I won’t repeat the proces over here, but <a href=\"http://kaspers.freeflux.net/blog/archive/2007/11/12/ipod-touch-1-1-1-to-1-1-2-upgrade-guide.html\">check it out at Koos Kaspers</a>. I’m already running the iPhone apps, and some 3rd party ones like Apollo (IM client), NES emulator and iSplit. Any other good apps you know of?</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/11/16/hacking-the-ipod-touch-firmware-112/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"hacking the ipod Touch firmware 1.1.2","date":"16 Nov, 2007","description":false,"tags":["apple","ipod","ipod touch"],"cover":{"publicURL":"/static/8d107181b3c5eb2b4cf98ae05f0d624c/preview.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8d107181b3c5eb2b4cf98ae05f0d624c/3c249/preview.jpg","srcSet":"/static/8d107181b3c5eb2b4cf98ae05f0d624c/3c249/preview.jpg 690w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/8d107181b3c5eb2b4cf98ae05f0d624c/956b7/preview.avif 690w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/8d107181b3c5eb2b4cf98ae05f0d624c/37026/preview.webp 690w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":1.3333333333333333}}}}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/11/16/hacking-the-ipod-touch-firmware-112/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2007/11/08/fotb07-rocked/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"FOTB07 rocked","tags":["Conferences"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2007/12/18/cakeswxphp-simpler-and-on-cake-12/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"cakeswxphp: simpler and on cake 1.2","tags":["amfphp","cakephp","cakeswxphp","swx"]}},"tag":["apple","ipod","ipod touch"]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2254173662","63159454"]}
