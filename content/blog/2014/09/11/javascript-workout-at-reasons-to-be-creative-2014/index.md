After [last year's elevator pitch](/2013/09/05/500-people-controlled-my-arduino-at-reasons-to-be-creative-2013/) I was invited back to gave a full talk this year. I wanted to elaborate on javascript and hardware interaction, while linking everything to a general theme. I went for "physical workouts", and built some demos that had to do with that.

During my talk, I covered different libraries & hardware platforms:

- Bluetooth LE & [the noble library](https://github.com/noble/noble)
- [Pulse Sensor](https://pulsesensor.com/)
- [Spark Core](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sparkdevices/spark-core-wi-fi-for-everything-arduino-compatible)
- [Johnny-five](http://johnny-five.io/)
- [Cylon.JS](https://cylonjs.com/)
- [Tessel](https://tessel.io/)
- [Spacebrew](http://docs.spacebrew.cc/)

I wanted to keep things fun and interactive for the audience as well. So I invited people on stage to play heartrate controlled games and dance mat challenges. All built using javascript!

The people from AnalogFolk captured a nice video of one of the demos:

You can [find my presentation and demos on Github](https://github.com/wouterverweirder/javascript-workout). Enjoy!
