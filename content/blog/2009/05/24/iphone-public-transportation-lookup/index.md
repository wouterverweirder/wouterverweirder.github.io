Some of you may know, I don’t own a car. So I take the public transportation a lot. I need to check the hours of trains, busses and metro’s very often, but their aren’t any mobile optimized travel-search services (that I know of) here in Belgium.

So I decided to write my own service, which enables you to lookup train, tram, metro and bus connections with your iPhone. Right know, it knows how to get from one bus station to another, I’ll implement other search options in the near future.

You can check it out at [http://labs.aboutme.be/itravel][1] (with your iphone :-))
