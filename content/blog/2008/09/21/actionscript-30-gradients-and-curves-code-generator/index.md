Now and then, I have to use the drawing API to draw a gradient, or a bezier curve. Every time, I have to dig through the help, to check the meaning of the different parameters, and where they belong in the function call. To make this more easy, I created a little code generator for gradients, and for drawing bezier curves with Actionscript 3.0.
