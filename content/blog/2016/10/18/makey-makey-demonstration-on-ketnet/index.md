[Ketnet](https://ketnet.be) was looking for somebody to showcase the [Makey Makey board](https://makeymakey.com/) on the Boeva & the games show. They reached out to me while I was on holiday during the summer, and of course I told them "yes!". The recordings were the day after I returned home from a 2 week holiday in California, so I was a little big jetlagged ;-)

During the 4 minute segment, I explained the possibilities of this neat little board: controlling a racing game using bananas, wrapping yourself in aluminum foil to play flappy bird or licking a bowl of water to play geometry dash. You can watch the segment below:

Apart from the jetlag, I had a ton of fun spending the afternoon in the tv studio. It was fun watching the kids [play the game I made for the show](/2016/10/01/phaser-and-arduino-game-for-ketnet) and seeing their enthousiastic responses to the Makey Makey games!
