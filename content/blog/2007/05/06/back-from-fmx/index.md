Back from FMX since yesterday evening! It was my first conference abroud, and I enjoyed it a lot!

Saw some inspiring sessions, such as the one from [André Michelle][1] about synthesizing audio in flash 9 and [Mario Klingemann][2] with “The Blind Sketchmaker” (can-computers-create-art-?-chinese-people-can).  
Thanks  a lot to [Peter Elst][3] for the guest ticket, and introducing me to some of the speakers over there! Had a great time during the conference and the buffet / party / quest-for-other-party-place afterwards. See you guys at [multi-mania][4] in a couple of weeks?
