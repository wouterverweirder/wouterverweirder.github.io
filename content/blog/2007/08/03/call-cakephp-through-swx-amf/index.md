As some of you might know, I’m a great fan of the cakephp framework. It is a rapid application framework for php. Cakephp already had a subproject called cakeamfphp. Looking at the code from cakeamfphp, I was able to get SWX running and call the cake controllers as remoting services.

Go to the [cakeswxphp page][1] for the latest downloads…

Just copy/past in your cake directory! Gateway locations are:

swx.php (SWX)  
amf.php (AMFPHP)  
json.php (JSON)

Currently it uses an adjusted version of SWX, based on SWX beta 1.0. I will try to update it to future versions of SWX when I get the time…
