Sorry for neglecting this follow-up post, but here it is: [the source code for the airserver space game][1] from [my previous post][2].

When the game is running, you can control it through websockets aswel, using the HTML5 Client in the repository. Deploy the client on a websurfer, and access it with an iPhone4 / iPod Touch 2 or iPad to control the game.

Enjoy!
