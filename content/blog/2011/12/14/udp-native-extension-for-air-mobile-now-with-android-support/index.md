I’ve continued my [work on my UDP AIR native extension][1], to add support for Android. I’m happy to release version 0.2, which adds Android support :-)

This means, from now on, you can send / receive UDP packets in your AIR mobile projects on both iOS & Android. If you find any bugs, or have suggestions, please let me know.

You can find the updated ane, sources and demo on github: [https://github.com/wouterverweirder/AIR-Mobile-UDP-Extension][2]

Enjoy!
