I wrote this game on top of my AIRServer library, as part of some multi-user explorations with the flash platform. The graphics were created by my [HOWEST][1] colleague [Jynse Cremers][2] :-)

Users can join a 30-second spacegame. Each user controls a spaceship with their smartphone. The game itself was built with Adobe AIR and the AIRServer actionscript library. To join the game users can choose between a native application built with Adobe AIR, or an html5/js websockets client in their browser.
