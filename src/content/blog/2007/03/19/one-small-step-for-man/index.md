The first public alpha of Apollo has launched!

Apollo is the code name for a cross-operating system runtime that allows you to leverage your existing web development skills (Flash, Flex, HTML, JavaScript, Ajax) to build and deploy rich Internet applications (RIAs) to the desktop.

I already experimented a bit with converting Flex Apps to Apollo standalone applications, and it rocks!

[Get Apollo on Adobe Labs][1].
