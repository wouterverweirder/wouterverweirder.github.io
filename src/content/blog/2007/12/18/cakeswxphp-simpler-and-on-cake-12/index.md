After some user input, I updated the cakeswxphp packages. I also started a branch which supports cakephp 1.2. There is a change in the gateway locations: you no longer connect to cake\_swx\_gateway.php or cake\_amf\_gateway.php, but to swx.php and amf.php (default locations in swx). This should make it even simpler to start with (cake)swx!

Again, you can [download it at the cakesxwphp page][1]â€¦
