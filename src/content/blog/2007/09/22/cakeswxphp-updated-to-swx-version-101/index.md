[Aral Balkan][1] released [SWX version 1.0][2] a few weeks ago. I finally found the time to incorporate the changes into CakeSWXPHP! The changes include the swxAssembler class (instead of the old swfCompiler) and the rebranded service explorer.

Go to the [cakeswxphp page][3] for the latest downloads!
