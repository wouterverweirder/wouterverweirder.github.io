I took some time updating my cakeswxphp package to the SWX beta 1.3. One of the new features is the new service explorer from SWX.

You can test your cake gateway, pointing your browser to the /explorer/ directory, gateway location being: cake\_amf\_gateway.php

Go to the [cakeswxphp page][1] for the latest downloads!

Enjoy!
